HOW TO obtain and plot the data

* move to the hpc cluster
* build with Make(file) ...
* submit the job with collect_batch_perm.sh or a similar uploader
* the results should be in a file named matmult_out.${JOB_ID}.txt
* rename the results to sth more meaningful, like *matmult_permutations_results.txt*
* [NEEDED ONLY ONCE] create a folder named plot/ with:
      mkdir plot/
* run the python formatter on them with:
      ./formatter.py matmult_out.${JOB_ID}.txt
   this splits the file in several txt's, one for each type (mnk, knm, blk, ..), taking it from the second column in the original file.
* use the MATLAB script Miguel created to plot the different graphs from the plot/ folder.
